This is a script that helps to click on all the Steam redeem key links on the Humble Bundle store, coded in Javascript. This will only redeem Steam keys.

You can use in conjunction with [Humble Pal](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/humble-pal/ngdpilmbmplccomcgkoggnodcmaomfnj) to automatically redeem a key when the Steam page is opened.

## Execution
1. Navigate to the redeem page on Humble Bundle (e.g. https://www.humblebundle.com/downloads?key=).
2. Open your browser console while on that page by pressing `F12` on Google Chrome, or `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `J` on Firefox.
3. Copy the [script.js](https://github.com/my3t/Humble-Bundle-Bulk-Redeem/blob/master/script.js) and paste into the console.
4. Run it by pressing `ENTER`.

## Note
This script will instantly force open all Steam redeem key links on a page. You are not encouraged to use if you have too many keys to redeem while on a low-mid end PC as it may crash your browser.
